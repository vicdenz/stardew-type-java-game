Ohh, hello! You startled me, I'm /sorry.
+No no, my apologies for intruding.
It's okay dear. What bring you /here?
+I'm ~0 of Littletown /police department. I'm here to /investigate the recent murder of /your husband.
Ohh, I was hoping you wouldn't /mentioned that.
+I just have a few questions /that's all.
+Alright, where were you the night /of the murder.
I was at home, in the kitchen making /a late night snack.
+Are you elaborating what happened /from your perspective?
At around 11, I left my bed and walked /downstairs to the kitchen.
Everything was fine, but all of a /sudden, I heard a faint scream and a /vase shattering.
I ran upstairs as fast as a old woman /like me can, and I found blood everywhere /and Antonio missing.
+Did you happen to see the killer /during the whole commotion.
Not really but I found a pair of /glasses and a skimask on the floor when I /was walked back upstairs.
+Okay, final question. Can you tell /me something about the house at the /top of the hill?
It used to be a library but after the /old librarian, Hubert, passed away, it was /closed from the public.
You should check around that area, /maybe you'll find some evidence.
+Well, thank you for your statement. /We'll be in touch soon.
