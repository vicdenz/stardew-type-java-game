Hey...!
My name is Brad Griffin, and this is my /brother Chad.
What are you up to in Littletown?
+I'm here to investigate the recent murder.
Sick! So you're a full blown detective. I /don't know much but many people say Big /Tony had it coming, he's always had a /shady past.
+What do you mean by that?
I've heard stories that he used to be part /of the mob, and it seems like his past /caught with him.
+Alright, thank you for telling me this.
