I'll tell you about Antonio but you /have to promise me that you won't tell a soul.
Seriously.
+Okay, I swear.
Alright. Long story short, Antonio or Big Tony /is a retired mobster with affiliations to the /West Dock Mob.
They're notorious for running shipping ports /in the shadows and smuggling illegal items /around the country.
Antonio was a high ranking member and even /in his retirement, he is feared in Littletown.
+So why was he murdered?
No one knows. Many people think it was Susan /herself. They're always fighting and Susan /thinks Antonio should turn himself in.
But, they still love each other I guess.
Personally, I think Rupert needs some looking /in to as his alibi was pretty weak.
+One last question, where can I find Susan?
She lives in the house just up the street.
+Thank you, Gus for all this information. You /seem to know a lot so I may need to /question you again.
No problem, question me anything it.
